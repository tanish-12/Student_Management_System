- **Additional Functionality**:
  - **Fullscreen Mode**: Initiates the application window in fullscreen mode for enhanced visibility and usability.
  - **Minimize and Exit**: Provides options to minimize the application window or exit the program, enhancing user convenience.

#### Conclusion:
The Student Management System offers a robust solution for educational institutions to efficiently manage student information, automate administrative tasks, and ensure data accuracy and integrity. With its intuitive interface, seamless database integration, and comprehensive functionality, it serves as an indispensable tool for streamlining student data management processes.
